## **Project Summary: Personality-Driven Experiences – ML Classification Case Study**

### **Overview**

ConnectSphere is launching a **Personality-Driven Experiences** feature to personalize user interactions on its social-wellness platform. The goal is to **infer each user’s personality type**—**Introvert** or **Extrovert**—based purely on in-app behavior, without using quizzes or self-reports. The model powers:

* **Tailored activity suggestions**
* **Smart engagement nudges**
* **Targeted premium upselling**

---

### **Business Problem**

**How can we predict personality from behavior to improve key metrics like engagement, retention, and revenue?**

**Key challenges:**

* No explicit personality labels
* Sparse and noisy behavioral data
* Need for **real-time** inference
* Demonstrating **measurable impact** on KPIs

---

### **Data Overview**

**User behavior features include:**

* Time spent alone, social event attendance, social media activity
* Comfort with new situations, energy after socializing, friend circle size

---

### **Key Findings**

#### **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

* **No duplicates** found post-fix of assignment issues
* **No outliers** detected using the IQR method
* **Missing values** imputed:

  * **Categorical** → mode
  * **Numerical** → median

#### **Feature Engineering**

* Created **interaction terms** and **polynomial features**

  * E.g., `GoingOut_Friends_Interaction`, `Time_Spent_Alone_Squared`
* Removed low-impact features (e.g., `Social_Alone_Interaction`)
* Retained features with **moderate to strong correlation** with personality

#### **Model Training & Optimization**

* Used **Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree**
* Tuned models via **GridSearchCV** with best parameters:

  * **Logistic Regression**: C=0.001, L1 penalty
  * **KNN**: 9 neighbors, Manhattan distance
  * **Decision Tree**: max\_depth=2

#### **Model Evaluation**

* All models showed **identical performance** on test data:

| Metric    | Score  |
| --------- | ------ |
| Accuracy  | 92.68% |
| Precision | 90.27% |
| Recall    | 93.58% |
| F1 Score  | 91.89% |
| AUC-ROC   | 92.77% |

> **Observation:** Identical results across models may indicate a simplistic dataset, possible feature overlap, or data leakage.

### **Business Impact**

A reliable personality classifier enables:

* **Customized user experiences**, enhancing relevance and satisfaction
* **Increased engagement**, through targeted nudges and event suggestions
* **Retention boosts**, by aligning with users’ social rhythms
* **Revenue growth**, via premium “Social Booster” upsells tailored to extroverted users

---

### **Next Steps**

* **Investigate identical performance:** Analyze for data leakage or overly deterministic features
* **Test advanced models:** Try **Random Forests**, **SVM**, or **ensemble approaches**
* **A/B test in production:** Validate the impact on engagement, session time, and conversion rates
* **Explore dimensionality reduction** (e.g., PCA) or feature clustering for richer behavior signals
